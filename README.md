![mockup image](https://github.com/sbstn98/images/blob/master/mockup.png)


Coding Resources - A VUE.js Application in that student of the Hamburg Coding School can filter and rate learning resources for Web-Development. The vision of the project is to provide students with a more effective and successful learning experience. 

The project is implemented in the front end with VUE.js and Tailwind CSS. The data is stored in a MySQL database and provided through a REST API built by myself. 

For the project, I spent a lot of time looking into design systems and paid a lot of attention to programming the VUE components as independently as possible. The user interface was designed in Figma and is based on the concept of Atomic Design by Brad Frost, after which the VUE.js components are also implemented (https://bradfrost.com/ ).


The following functions are available:

- Display the Resources
- Add a new Resource
- See a Detail view
- Rate the Resource
- Filter the Resources by Technic, Language, and Rating
- It is Responsive for Mobile and Desktop

Technic used:

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Express js
- MySQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Atomic Design

Backend: https://github.com/sbstn98/coding-resources-rest-api

Roadmap:

- Implement a search function
- Use query parameters to filter and search the resources
- Improve the structure of the REST API
